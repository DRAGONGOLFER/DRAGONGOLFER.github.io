		<h5>Blog Post 1</h5>
		<p>Today was the first day of the Helium group of students, and it started off with the accounts not working! Though my account was in a different place before so I guess I have to cut the IT guy some slack on that one. We set up our source control today, id est github and then configured our setups, made all the accounts and such. All that good stuff. We also made a twitter bot today using the tweepy api! I am trolling people with various simpsons quotes, latin idioms, and posts about how awesome dave is, and how much like bacon he is. I had a good day today, I enjoyed meeting everyone so that was fun. I also got to teach people how git works. WOO! Teaching is fun.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 2</h5>
		<p>Today was the second and equally awesome day of awesomeness. I worked on the labs, we covered conditional statements today and started working with if/elif/else statements. I took a lot of notes and all that jazz. But the highlight of my day was starting work on a SSListenBot/Exploit Deployment system as a proof of concept bot that has various exploits hard coded into it. I am building it in python and basically leanred most of the SSL record formats along with the 4 record types and started building my own heartbeat and client hello requests. I am surprised I made so much progress today. It was quite Awesome! I also helped some of the other students with various concepts and labs.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 3</h5>
		<p>It was another resoundingly awesome day here at devcodecamp, I got a lot done again. I made a lot more progress on my SSListener, having added a fatal unexpected message that will only be sent when I tell the bot to closing the connection, but the bot keeps sending to keep the server occupied and thus offline by proxy. We also are making a new dice game and I decided to rewrite mine from scratch in an object oriented way using classes to have as many players as I want and redefined the rules with the other students so its interesting doing it again.I have most of my game logic done, and am now working on the class object for the players and am working out how to play against the CPU. Hopefully I will make more progress when I get home but I am kind of spent, and I am not entirely sure why. Maybe its from doing hexadecimal math in my head when I was building the SSL records to be sent. Its one of those things thats pretty easy but at the same time really complicated depending on what I am modifying or adding to the request to be sent. Im hoping I can get everything working with that by the end of the week so I can start testing it and adding and improving functionality. But ya twas a great day!</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 4</h5>
		<p>Well today was pretty great as well. I made some progress on my dicewar program and started again writing it in an object oriented way instead of it being almost entirely conditional. so huzzur. I also got to work on my SSListener a bit more. I just realized if you pronounce that exactly as it sounds it is SS-Listener, like you are listening to what the German SS is talking about. Ha. I also learned a few things I didnt the first time around such as the strip(), l/rstrip() which allow you to remove whitespace or whatever you put inside the () so that was pretty cool. I am going to continue working on the dice game tonight as well as some other things should I have enoug time to do so. Other than that I am going to try and relax tonight and get as much as I can done before friday, but I am not behind, I just want to keep working! :)</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 5</h5>
		<p>I had a really really productive day today. I started really understanding the concepts of object oriented programming and I now have some really good id3as for my dice game mainily making everything classes, the player, the dice, the game, and making all my functions methods of those classes instead of having just free floating functions errywhere and having a small two line file that initializes the game similar to my bot which just calls all the other files in the correct sequence(for lack of a better word) and thats that. So Im quite happy with that, Im also really happy with andrews style of teaching and how he is letting us just roll with our dice game because he sees that we are learning a lot of concepts from it instead of stopping us and moving us to the next thing. In general Im happy that I started the program over again. So ye, I shall return on the morrow with more musings.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 6</h5>
		<p>Today was a Monday, and it was a pretty good monday, so huzzur! We started working on an object oriented game as a group(helium) and we got the source control set up and started on the game so bam. Im pretty happy with what I got done today even though it was a monday, though I am annoyed with my laptop because I have to manually install all of the lenovo drivers. So thats a bummerski. But anyway I also worked on my SSListener a bit more and set up some virtual machines on my workstation. But ye, it has been a good day. Im excited for tomorrow and working on my dicegame and our OHSHIT! game, yes that is the name we went with. Its a computer vs a granola bar vs a notepad vs a backpack, so that will be interesting to see. Anyway I shall see you on the morrow!</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 7</h5>
		<p>So I am the project manager for our group game OHSHIT! and thats pretty cool. Im to divy up tasks depending on what needs to be completed. I also started thiking of ideas for my personal project, but I might just elaborate on my SSListener or just do a basic echobot, Im not sure. We shall see. I had a good day. I need to go home and read a decent amount. So ye, thats what Im going to do. Problably work on the project as well. I think I will keep it kind of short today because a lot of the time was spent on our game. I shall see you on the morrow.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 8</h5>
		<p>So we finished OHSHIT today! It actually turned out quite well. I enjoyed being the project lead, and we all learned a lot. I also started on my personal project which is a proof of concept malware that forces a computer offline by generating an infinite amount of numbers and spawning a new process to check each number, consuming all the RAM flooding the process table and shuting the system down. I can generate the numbers, but Im running into trouble checking if they are prime because the loop never gets to that function. But I think I found a workaround so we shall see. I am excited to go home and test that. I will keep you posted.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 9</h5>
		<p>I had an awesome day today! I worked through three different versions of my fork bomb, trying to create the most effective version I could. At first it took about 4-5 minutes to kill a computer, on my third, I was testing on my development machine, thinking it wouldnt spawn that many processes that fast I ran it thinking I could do a keyboard interrupt, but it took 10 seconds to take effect and crashed my computer not the VM. So that was awesome, I started building a WMI console application to look at the health of the system as the fork bomb is running, and implement functionality to control the rate of process creation/destruction so I can see how it affects the computer. I am looking forward to going home and working on this more.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 10</h5>
		<p>I know I had a good day when I am super spent like depleted uranium at the end of it. I learned a lot today, I got my MVP of my WMI-console built, and now Im working on adding functionality that lets me deploy my various logic bombs remotely for stress testing. I am also working on my IO bomb now, and that will be interesting to see it when its done. I also had the code test problem today which was to build class objects for a colony and ants, I ended up consolidating them into one class, set type queen or worker, set location as a series of 3D coordinates, and set the queens mating to only one worker, and stored all the data about each ant in a dictionary. This was just a whiteboard problem so it was pretty pseudocodey though I did do well. We also started a Lemonade Stand program today, and thats a bit of a challenge because there are so many variables that have to affect each other before anything can be done with them, so Im going to work on that this weekend.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 11</h5>
		<p>Well now, today was an awesome monday, I got the source control set up for our new group project led by Brandon, which is a clone of the game Asteroids! We are working with pygame to animate it and I am working on the astroids themselves. I have to create the objects, generate random movement, and eventually add collision so they break into smaller asteroids instead of just disappearing when they die so its turning out to be a really really awesome. Brandon is doing a fantastic job as team leader as well. I am the unoffical lead developer under brandon as well so thats tons of fun! I shall return on the morrow with stories of success!</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 12</h5>
		<p>Today was a fantastic day, but I am extreemly fried. I was working on generating the astroids in pygame, and I ran into a lot of challenges with that since the documentation was inaccessable, so through trial and error I got it to work! So that was awesome, but I am still annoyed that the solution was simpler than I needed it to be. But what I did works, and even though it is more complicated I figured it out completly on my own. SO HAHA!</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 13</h5>
		<p>I am incredibly happy right now, I got my asteroids working properly, AND I wrote my own function using trignometry to check for collision detection using the pythagorean theorem which was effin awesome! Im really happy that my trigonometry is coming back to me, as I hadnt gotten to use it for so long. SO WIN! Tomorrow I am going to work on getting the asteroids to meander around space with some help from the law of cosines bro! I will also be using that equation to help me work out the fracturing of the asteroids on collision with the laser, going about three layers deep in terms of how many times it can break. Especially after this morning where we had some issues with out source control. Id Est we had to change the way it was set up. So thats good news. Our Daily Build turned out quite well IMO. I will return on tomorrow!</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 14</h5>
		<p>So I had another good day today, I got soooo much done. I got my asteroids to split apart and have smaller radii on collision with a bullet, the spin works better, they now meander along an orbital path so to speak, and there are different sized graphics for the asteroids, graphics for explosions, and sounds to go with them. Our game is really shaping up. Its lovely. I did a lot of maths today to get the meandering to work and it was a lot of fun actually, getting to use that knowledge again. Ill keep this brief today because I am kind of fried so ye. I will return.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 15</h5>
		<p>Wow today was a great damn day, but I am so exhauseted. We got out clone of asteroids finished, and I am incredibly proud of what we did and what I did, and the way I approached the collision detection building my own functions for that vs using pygames. We then went to PKware for a tour, and that was the best part of my day. I love security and encryption, and I was pushing myself asking all sorts of questions. I could totally see myself working there, it would be such a good fit for me. I am going to ask bob to help me write up an email to send on monday, as I would really really like to pursue that. Im going to wrap this up because im incredibly spent. I shall return on monday!</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 16</h5>
		<p>Well it was monday and it was a fantastic monday! We started HTML, CSS, and JavaScript today and took our python exams which I kicked a lot of ass on. I got all the labs done today, and then I was playing around with PyBrain and set up a base neural network and started training it. I also thought of a really cool personal project, Involving the keygen tag in HTML 5 and allowing people to send me encrypted messages right from my blog. That would be pretty awesome in my opinion. I am going to go home tonight and figure out how to set up various tools I need for JavaScript which arent a whole lot. Im pretty much good to go there, but ye. It was an awesome day.</p>

		<h5>Blog Post 17</h5>
		<p>WOOO such a great day. We worked on more JavaScript, and I am really happy that we learned about objects specifically in JS today, it was very helpful for working on the labs which we did about 4-5 of. Im really glad that I understand computer time now, and the way I used it to solve the birthday difference problem in the most recent lab. We also did another obfuscated code challenge today, helium was paired with hydrogen, so it was me and spencer, and we made ours pretty resoundingly evil and hard to decode. My understanding of JavaScript is much more thourough this time around, and its really helping a lot. Im just in a very good humor today. So I will wrap this up so I can keep working. I will see you all on the morrow!</p>
